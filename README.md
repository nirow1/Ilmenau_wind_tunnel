**Wind Tunnel Ilmenau**

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the wind tunnel in Ilmenau, developed by 4Jtech.

**Overview**

The GUI, built using PySide6 and Snap7, continuously monitors device states through Siemens LOGO! controllers. When the device is in the correct state, users can adjust wind velocity and wind temperature. Additionally, the application records temperature data over time and displays it in a temperature chart.

**Technologies Used**

PySide6: For creating the graphical user interface.

Snap7: For communication with Siemens LOGO! controllers.

**Features**

Device State Monitoring: Checks the device state in a loop using Siemens LOGO! controllers.

Control Functions: Allows users to adjust wind velocity and wind temperature.

Data Logging: Saves and charts device temperature data over time.
